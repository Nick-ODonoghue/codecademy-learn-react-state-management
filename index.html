    <h2>React Programming Patterns</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Separate Container Components From Presentational Components</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>When a component has too many responsibilities and becomes difficult to maintain, it's a good idea to split
          it into multiple simpler components.</li>
        <li>The pattern of splitting components into stateful (container) and stateless (presentational) components
          helps reduce complexity.</li>
        <li>Stateful components handle complex state management and logic, while stateless components focus on rendering
          JSX.</li>
        <li>By separating concerns, we can improve code organization and maintainability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Create Container Component</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The container component is responsible for the functional part of a component, such as maintaining state and
          performing calculations based on props.</li>
        <li>It is also known as a stateful component because it manages the state of the application.</li>
        <li>The container component passes the state and other necessary data to the components it renders through
          props.</li>
        <li>By separating the functional logic into a container component, we can keep the presentational components
          focused on rendering JSX and improve code organization.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Create Presentational Component</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A presentational component, also known as a stateless component, is responsible for rendering JSX.</li>
        <li>It should only contain JSX and should not handle any state or logic.</li>
        <li>The presentational component should be exported so that it can be used by the container component.</li>
        <li>The container component will be responsible for rendering the presentational component and passing the
          necessary props to it.</li>
        <li>Even though a presentational component doesn't maintain state, it can still be reactive. Changes in props
          can trigger a re-rendering of the JSX.</li>
        <img src="" alt="presentational component">
        <img src="" alt="container component">
        <li>In the example provided, the presentational component is exported and imported by the container component,
          which is responsible for rendering it.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Parent/Child and Sibling/Sibling Communication</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Presentational components communicate changes to container components by invoking a change handler function
          passed to them as a prop.</li>
        <img src="" alt="incorrect update of props">
        <li>Components should never directly update their props, as React functional components should be pure
          functions.</li>
        <li>The container component defines and provides the change handler function to the presentational component
          through a prop.</li>
        <img src="" alt="correct update of props">
        <li>In the example provided, the Container component maintains the isActive state and passes the setIsActive
          function to the Presentational component through the toggle prop.</li>
        <li>When the Presentational component needs to communicate a change to the active prop, it calls the function
          provided through the toggle prop, passing the updated value.</li>
        <li>The change in the active prop triggers a re-rendering of both the Presentational component and any other
          sibling components that receive the active prop from the Container component.</li>
        <li>This pattern enables communication between parent and child components and indirectly results in
          communication between sibling components with a common parent.</li>
        <li>It promotes a unidirectional flow of data, with state and change handlers defined in the container component
          and passed down to presentational components as props.</li>
      </ul>
